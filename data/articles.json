        "content":"The road from design to production is often hard-won, filled with well-intended design detours, steep learning curves, and the occasional road block. Here’s a common scenario: A team of designers begins building wireframes for a new product. Several weeks, revisions, and pin-ups later, they emerge with a “final,” “shippable” file, which they hand off to the development team. The engineers poke holes in the design, deeming several elements “unbuildable,” and begin rendering out some semblance of the design in code. Several weeks later, they deliver a staging site. The designers are thrilled—this is the first time they’ve seen their design IRL—but are quickly deflated when they realize how much of the design has been lost in translation. The typography is wonky. The animations and interactive elements need to be re-tuned. A volley of annotated emails with screenshots ensues, until finally, the designer and developer sit side-by-side, and visually adjust the design directly in code."

        "content":"Nobody knows your brand better than you do. This is why when we set out to create the framework for material design, we were sensitive to the ways in which third-party developers might leverage the system. We wanted material design to give comprehensive guidance for designing effective and elegant UIs — taking a strong position on motion, dimensionality, color, and graphic hierarchy — but with enough latitude to allow for various levels of engagement. You don’t have to adopt every element of the material design system in order for it to be beneficial to your identity system. Whether it’s a custom font, a unique color story, or distinct voice, everything that provides stylistic distinction in a product should be celebrated and supported in the material design framework. We’ve laid out the top brand touchpoints to help illustrate the system’s flexibility and give designers and developers a road map for showcasing their brand identity."

Here are a few of the stories I found helpful for framing the discussion. A thorough account of using Form (pre 1.3) for the first time, from the perspective of a designer who is less familiar with Quarz Composer, with built prototypes to help synthesize the material covered in each section.

        "content":"Every wondered why a pint of beer can taste amazing one day and average the next? It could be the angle it was poured from. For a long time people have believed that beer should be poured at a 45 degree angle to taste its best. But new research has revealed that this only applies when pouring beer from a long tap, and is, in fact, too high when pouring from a bottle. Food scientist and writer Dr Stuart Farrimond undertook a study to asses the different pouring angles when pouring from a 500ml bottle into various glasses. He found that pouring from a bottle at more than 15 degrees resulted in rapid bubble formation and a tall beer head that ultimately impaired the taste of the beer. When poured at a lower angle (15 degrees being the optimum), the speed at which the beer hits the glass is slower, meaning there is less bubble formation, a shorter beer head and a much better tasting beer. The bubbles in beer have a unique structure that is vital to their flavour. The bubbles have a rough ‘skin’ which causes them to rise more slowly and grow larger than other carbonated drinks. This experiment, which was commissioned to mark the CAMRA Beer Festival at Ascot Racecourse this weekend, also revealed that a wide-rimmed straight-sided glass is preferable to the traditional curved pint glass for achieving the perfect beer head, and that 20⁰C is the perfect temperature. Although many people enjoy a cold beer, Dr Farrimond found that as the temperature of beer falls, so does the tongue’s ability to perceive its flavours. He claims that 20⁰C is the ideal compromise for taste and pleasure. This changes with different beers however.  Dr Farrimond suggested that lagers and pale ales should be drunk at or below 5C, so that the \"hop bitterness\" is not too overpowering, while a medium English ale is best served at 18.5⁰C, and a dark at 21⁰C."

        "content":"Modern web applications are not only complex to design but also quite difficult to develop. Given the range of tools involved, amount of testing required, and the combination of libraries/frameworks used, the development process has become harder. As the application scales over a period of time, it becomes harder to maintain the code and make enhancements. The W3C aims to address this problem by introducing Web Components. Web components are a collection of specifications that enable developers to create their web applications as a set of reusable components. Web Components provide a paradigm shift from the traditional approach of web design by fundamentally changing the way we build and conceive web apps.Each component lives in its self-defined encapsulated unit with corresponding style and behavior logic. These components can not only be shared across a single web application but can also be distributed on the web for use by others.Web components are made up of four different specifications:Custom Elements – These enable developers to create their own elements that are relevant to their design as part of the DOM structure with the ability to style/script them just like any other HTML tag.HTML Templates – These let you define fragments of markup that stay consistent across web pages with the ability to inject dynamic content using JavaScript.Shadow DOM – This is designed to abstract all the complexities from the markup by defining functional boundaries between the DOM tree and the subtrees hidden behind a shadow root.HTML Imports – Similar to import one CSS file into another, these allow you to include and reuse HTML documents in other HTML documents.What is Polymer?The specifications introduced above are quite new and it is hardly surprising to know that browser support is not very good. But, thanks to the Polymer library, created by the awesome folks at Google, we can use all these features in modern browsers today. Polymer provides a set of polyfills that enables us to use web components in non-compliant browsers with an easy-to-use framework. Polymer does this by:Allowing us to create Custom Elements with user-defined naming schemes. These custom elements can then be distributed across the network and used by others with HTML Imports.Allowing each custom element to have its own template accompanied by styles and behavior required to use that element.Providing a suite of ready-made UI and non-UI elements to use and extend in your project."

Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java.This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.Java programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform (Java 1.0 [J2SE]).The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.Java is −Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.Secure − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.Architecture-neutral − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.Robust − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.Multithreaded − With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.Interpreted − Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.High Performance − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.Distributed − Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.Dynamic − Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time."

We hosted FORM, Google’s first-ever design conference in San Francisco and engaged in numerous outreach efforts through workshops, design sprints, and online discussions. We’ve continued to improve and expand on the material design guidelines and have witnessed countless teams both inside and outside Google adopt the framework and ship beautiful, materialized products across platforms. To better capture all this great design work happening at Google and around the community, we’ve completely reconceived Google Design. In addition to all the guidelines and resources you’ve come to rely on, we’ve also released guides for TV, Auto, and Cardboard, our virtual reality product. Our new Icon Library allows you to download our icon font and source from the over 800 material system icons. We’ve also added a whole new layer of written and video content — everything from tutorials, case-studies, interviews, and essays, to a listing of job opportunities and design-related events, like our upcoming FORM conference. The goal is to provide a new perspective on our design process and ample opportunity for cross pollination. Now you can watch an animated color tutorial before you dive into the nitty gritty details in our material design guidelines, or get some practical guidance around designing between platforms. Our Making Material Design series takes you behind-the-scenes to find out what it takes to create a new visual framework for Google. Additionally, we’ve launched new Dribbble and YouTube channels to complement our active Twitter and Google+ presence and can share even more real-time content from our design teams.
